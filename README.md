# deep-learning-tasks
A repository with machine learning assignments:

1. Image classification –– finetuning a pretrained Resnet-152 model for dogs images classification (50 classes) –– 92% accuracy
2. ML pipeline –– training some basic ML algorithms (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest) on a toy dataset, hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV), as well as data preprocessing (normalization, PCA)
3. Training on MNIST –– training a small self-made CNN on MNIST and achieving 99% accuracy
4. UCI HAR dataset training –– training a CNN for human activity classification based on time series data –– 91% accuracy achieved
